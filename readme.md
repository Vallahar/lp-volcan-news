## Lava Flow Tracker
This is an initiative to build a web-app to visualise as closely as possible the evolution of the lava rivers in the current eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano in La Palma, Canary Islands Spain.

Original idea would include the use of Copernicus Global Land Service, though I'm uneducated in the tool.

**In essence, any way of retrieving real-time satellite images of a specific area of the planet would be a good start.**

Then ideally, using thermal imaging and other techniques it'd be possible to narrow down the paths the lava is taking.

## Emergency Summary
A way of centralising the multiple flows of information that overwhelm the population.

- Government recommendations.
- Map with closed roads.
- Ways of helping, and what's required.
